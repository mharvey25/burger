# Eat-Da-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is an app that lets you create any burger you like, and then devour it!

## Description

This app was created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. It also uses the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
